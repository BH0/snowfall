_______
Similarly to the way Brad Traversy allows the user to customize the plugin via a form which is created within the public function "form" and then something happens in public function "update" - I want my plugin/widget to allow the user to enter data (integers but strings will do for now) into a HTML form and then send these values to a JSON file, how would I do this and would I do it inside the widget class?
